Discovery and Molecular Characterization of Pathogens

The first research axis of this unit will be the discovery and molecular characterization of pathogens from primary samples based on the use of different high throughput sequencing technologies. The second axis will be the search for prognostic markers to anticipate the progression of precancerous lesions to malignancy for cervical cancer. Finally, this research unit will also provide the other research teams at the centre with access to the various high-throughput sequencing technologies for bacterial and/or viral metagenomic research projects.
